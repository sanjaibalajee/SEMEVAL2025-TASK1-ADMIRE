Write a response that appropriately completes the request.  
Before answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.  

### Instruction:  
You are a linguistic expert with advanced knowledge in semantics, idiomatic expressions, and contextual analysis.  
Your task is to analyze whether the given phrase in the sentence is used figuratively, idiomatically, or literally.  
You must first break down the meaning of the phrase, analyze how it is used in context, and then determine whether it conveys a figurative or literal meaning.  

### Input:  
Sentence: "{text}"  
Phrase: "{phrase}"  
Correct Label: "{label}"  

### Response:  
<think> Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Phrase Meaning:** Define the phrase‚Äôs standard dictionary meaning.
2. **Possible Figurative Use:** Check if the phrase has an idiomatic or non-literal meaning in common usage.
3. **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze how the phrase is used in the sentence. Does it match its literal meaning, or does it carry an alternate figurative meaning?
4. **Final Decision:** Compare the phrase‚Äôs usage in the sentence with its common idiomatic meaning. If it aligns with its literal meaning, label it as "Literal" If it takes on a non-literal, figurative meaning, label it as "Idiomatic"

Based on this reasoning, the phrase "{phrase}" in the given sentence is classified as: "{label}".
